    "## Introduction to Computational Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers have for many years played a vital role in the acquisition and treatment of experimental data, but they have more recently taken up a much more extended role in physics research. The numerical and algebraic calculations now performed on modern computers make it possible to explore consequences of basic theories in a way which goes beyond the limits of both analytic insight and experimental investigation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically,The birth of computational physics can be traced back to the late 1960s.Computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science. It is sometimes regarded as a subdiscipline (or offshoot) of theoretical physics, but others consider it an intermediate branch between theoretical and experimental physics - an area of study which supplements both theory and experiment.\n",
    "Computational physics complements the areas of theory and experimentation in traditional scientific investigation. \n",
    "Areas of application include environmental modeling, nuclear cleanup, the design of materials, ground water transport, the nature of elementary particles, medical imaging, and energy management. A computational physicist understands not only the workings of computers and the relevant science and mathematics, but also how computer algorithms and simulations connect the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve scientific problems using computational methods; it combines computer science, physics and applied mathematics to develop scientific solutions to complex problems.**\n",
    "In conclusion: Computational physics will allow you to tackle realistic problems in practically every field of science and engineering.\n",

    "The aim is to solve the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional potential well using the finite difference method, a computational physics technique. To address a real-world problem that is challenging or impossible to solve using conventional analytical techniques, we are applying numerical techniques and computer programs."
